#Elixir Outdoors

This is a simple scaffold to use [Laravel Elixir](https://github.com/laravel/elixir) without requires **Laravel Framework** to be installed.

Learn more about Laravel Framework: [laravel.com](http://laravel.com)

Elixir Outdoors provides a simple and customizable structure to getting started with your frontend project.


##Starting
> This README is a work in progress!

In order to use Elixir Outdoors you need to have `nodejs` and `gulp` installed.
Find more about how to get `nodejs` at: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)
Find more about `gulp` at: [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

clone the repo:

    git clone git://github.com/marcim/elixir-outdoors.git my_project_folder

Then enter the folder created and run `npm install` to install Laravel Elixir and his dependencies.

    cd my_project_folder
    npm install

Now just run `gulp` to build the initial files.

Take a look at the folder structure:

- Think the `public` folder as the build folder project. Here you will find an `index.html` file, this is where you get start with your frontend.
- The `src` folder is where your assets sources files go. If you are familiarized with **Laravel Framework** the `src` folder is equivalent to `resurces/assets` folder.
